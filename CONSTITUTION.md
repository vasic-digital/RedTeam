# CONSTITUTION -- digital.vasic.redteam (RedTeam)

This Constitution governs the `digital.vasic.redteam` Go module
(YAML-driven adversarial prompt fixture harness for defensive LLM
guardrail regression testing). It inherits, in full, the HelixAgent
root Constitution (`HelixAgent/CONSTITUTION.md`) and the universal
mandatory rules below. Module-specific addenda may extend but not
weaken those rules.

## Module Identity

- **Module path**: `digital.vasic.redteam`
- **Language**: Go (stdlib + `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`)
- **Primary consumer**: HelixAgent (`dev.helix.agent`),
  `internal/security/redteam_fixtures.go`
- **Source of truth**: this repository, mirrored to GitHub + GitLab
  (`vasic-digital/RedTeam`)

## Module-Specific Constitutional Rules (DEFENSIVE USE ONLY)

1. **Defensive-only framing.** This library exists so that
   adversarial fixtures can be replayed through a consumer's
   guardrail pipeline and EVERY fixture is blocked. Repurposing the
   corpus for offensive payload generation is prohibited.
2. **No attack-string generators.** This module MUST NOT export
   helpers that mutate fixtures into novel obfuscated payloads,
   generate new attack strings from seeds, or otherwise enlarge the
   downstream attack surface.
3. **Fixture invariants.** Every fixture MUST declare
   `expected_guardrail_trigger` and a `severity` tier; loader shape
   invariants are enforced in `fixtures.go` and MUST stay green.
4. **Acceptance gate.** The HelixAgent integration MUST keep
   `47/47 fixtures blocked` by `StandardGuardrailPipeline`. Drops
   below 47/47 are release blockers.
5. **No network I/O, no live model calls.** This module is pure
   stdlib + YAML parsing. New dependencies require explicit
   justification.
6. **Resource-capped tests.** `GOMAXPROCS=2 nice -n 19 ionice -c 3 go
   test -count=1 -p 1 -race ./...` is the canonical test invocation.



## Universal Mandatory Constraints

These rules are inherited from the cross-project Universal Mandatory Development Constraints (canonical source: `/tmp/UNIVERSAL_MANDATORY_RULES.md`, derived from the HelixAgent root `CLAUDE.md`). They are non-negotiable across every project, submodule, and sibling repository. Project-specific addenda are welcome but cannot weaken or override these.

### Hard Stops (permanent, non-negotiable)

1. **NO CI/CD pipelines.** No `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.travis.yml`, `.circleci/`, or any automated pipeline. No Git hooks either. All builds and tests run manually or via Makefile / script targets.
2. **NO HTTPS for Git.** SSH URLs only (`git@github.com:…`, `git@gitlab.com:…`, etc.) for clones, fetches, pushes, and submodule operations. Including for public repos. SSH keys are configured on every service.
3. **NO manual container commands.** Container orchestration is owned by the project's binary / orchestrator (e.g. `make build` → `./bin/<app>`). Direct `docker`/`podman start|stop|rm` and `docker-compose up|down` are prohibited as workflows. The orchestrator reads its configured `.env` and brings up everything.

### Mandatory Development Standards

1. **100% Test Coverage.** Every component MUST have unit, integration, E2E, automation, security/penetration, and benchmark tests. No false positives. Mocks/stubs ONLY in unit tests; all other test types use real data and live services.
2. **Challenge Coverage.** Every component MUST have Challenge scripts (`./challenges/scripts/`) validating real-life use cases. No false success — validate actual behavior, not return codes.
3. **Real Data.** Beyond unit tests, all components MUST use actual API calls, real databases, live services. No simulated success. Fallback chains tested with actual failures.
4. **Health & Observability.** Every service MUST expose health endpoints. Circuit breakers for all external dependencies. Prometheus / OpenTelemetry integration where applicable.
5. **Documentation & Quality.** Update `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and relevant docs alongside code changes. Pass language-appropriate format/lint/security gates. Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.
6. **Validation Before Release.** Pass the project's full validation suite (`make ci-validate-all`-equivalent) plus all challenges (`./challenges/scripts/run_all_challenges.sh`).
7. **No Mocks or Stubs in Production.** Mocks, stubs, fakes, placeholder classes, TODO implementations are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in production code. All production code is fully functional with real integrations. Only unit tests may use mocks/stubs.
8. **Comprehensive Verification.** Every fix MUST be verified from all angles: runtime testing (actual HTTP requests / real CLI invocations), compile verification, code structure checks, dependency existence checks, backward compatibility, and no false positives in tests or challenges. Grep-only validation is NEVER sufficient.
9. **Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges (CRITICAL).** ALL test and challenge execution MUST be strictly limited to 30-40% of host system resources. Use `GOMAXPROCS=2`, `nice -n 19`, `ionice -c 3`, `-p 1` for `go test`. Container limits required. The host runs mission-critical processes — exceeding limits causes system crashes.
10. **Bugfix Documentation.** All bug fixes MUST be documented in `docs/issues/fixed/BUGFIXES.md` (or the project's equivalent) with root cause analysis, affected files, fix description, and a link to the verification test/challenge.
11. **Real Infrastructure for All Non-Unit Tests.** Mocks/fakes/stubs/placeholders MAY be used ONLY in unit tests (files ending `_test.go` run under `go test -short`, equivalent for other languages). ALL other test types — integration, E2E, functional, security, stress, chaos, challenge, benchmark, runtime verification — MUST execute against the REAL running system with REAL containers, REAL databases, REAL services, and REAL HTTP calls. Non-unit tests that cannot connect to real services MUST skip (not fail).
12. **Reproduction-Before-Fix (CONST-032 — MANDATORY).** Every reported error, defect, or unexpected behavior MUST be reproduced by a Challenge script BEFORE any fix is attempted. Sequence: (1) Write the Challenge first. (2) Run it; confirm fail (it reproduces the bug). (3) Then write the fix. (4) Re-run; confirm pass. (5) Commit Challenge + fix together. The Challenge becomes the regression guard for that bug forever.
13. **Concurrent-Safe Containers (Go-specific, where applicable).** Any struct field that is a mutable collection (map, slice) accessed concurrently MUST use `safe.Store[K,V]` / `safe.Slice[T]` from `digital.vasic.concurrency/pkg/safe` (or the project's equivalent primitives). Bare `sync.Mutex + map/slice` combinations are prohibited for new code.

### Definition of Done (universal)

A change is NOT done because code compiles and tests pass. "Done" requires pasted terminal output from a real run, produced in the same session as the change.

- **No self-certification.** Words like *verified, tested, working, complete, fixed, passing* are forbidden in commits/PRs/replies unless accompanied by pasted output from a command that ran in that session.
- **Demo before code.** Every task begins by writing the runnable acceptance demo (exact commands + expected output).
- **Real system, every time.** Demos run against real artifacts.
- **Skips are loud.** `t.Skip` / `@Ignore` / `xit` / `describe.skip` without a trailing `SKIP-OK: #<ticket>` comment break validation.
- **Evidence in the PR.** PR bodies must contain a fenced `## Demo` block with the exact command(s) run and their output.

### CONST-033 — Host Power Management is Forbidden

**Status:** Mandatory. Non-negotiable. Applies to every project,
submodule, container entry point, build script, test, challenge, and
systemd unit shipped from this repository.

**Rule:** No code in this repository may invoke a host-level power-
state transition (suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-
hibernate, poweroff, halt, reboot, kexec) on the host machine. This
includes — but is not limited to:

- `systemctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}`
- `loginctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}`
- `pm-{suspend,hibernate,suspend-hybrid}`
- `shutdown {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to any value other than `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

**Why:** The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI-agent and
container workloads. On 2026-04-26 18:23:43 the host was auto-
suspended by the GDM greeter's idle policy mid-session, killing
HelixAgent and 41 dependent services. Recurring memory-pressure
SIGKILLs of `user@1000.service` (perceived as "logged out") have the
same outcome. Auto-suspend, hibernate, and any power-state transition
are unsafe for this host.

**Defence in depth (mandatory artifacts in every project):**
1. `scripts/host-power-management/install-host-suspend-guard.sh` —
   privileged installer, manual prereq, run once per host with sudo.
   Masks `sleep.target`, `suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`,
   `hybrid-sleep.target`; writes `AllowSuspend=no` drop-in; sets
   logind `IdleAction=ignore` and `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`.
2. `scripts/host-power-management/user_session_no_suspend_bootstrap.sh` —
   per-user, no-sudo defensive layer. Idempotent. Safe to source from
   `start.sh` / `setup.sh` / `bootstrap.sh`.
3. `scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` —
   static scanner. Exits non-zero on any forbidden invocation.
4. `challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` — asserts
   the running host's state matches layer-1 masking.
5. `challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` — wraps the
   scanner as a challenge that runs in CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Enforcement:** Every project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`
equivalent MUST run both challenges (host state + source tree). A
violation in either channel blocks merge. Adding files to the
scanner's `EXCLUDE_PATHS` requires an explicit justification comment
identifying the non-host context.

**See also:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` for full background and
runbook.

<!-- CONST-035 anti-bluff addendum (cascaded) -->

## CONST-035 — Anti-Bluff Tests & Challenges (mandatory; inherits from root)

Tests and Challenges in this submodule MUST verify the product, not
the LLM's mental model of the product. A test that passes when the
feature is broken is worse than a missing test — it gives false
confidence and lets defects ship to users. Functional probes at the
protocol layer are mandatory:

- TCP-open is the FLOOR, not the ceiling. Postgres → execute
  `SELECT 1`. Redis → `PING` returns `PONG`. ChromaDB → `GET
  /api/v1/heartbeat` returns 200. MCP server → TCP connect + valid
  JSON-RPC handshake. HTTP gateway → real request, real response,
  non-empty body.
- Container `Up` is NOT application healthy. A `docker/podman ps`
  `Up` status only means PID 1 is running; the application may be
  crash-looping internally.
- No mocks/fakes outside unit tests (already CONST-030; CONST-035
  raises the cost of a mock-driven false pass to the same severity
  as a regression).
- Re-verify after every change. Don't assume a previously-passing
  test still verifies the same scope after a refactor.
- Verification of CONST-035 itself: deliberately break the feature
  (e.g. `kill <service>`, swap a password). The test MUST fail. If
  it still passes, the test is non-conformant and MUST be tightened.

## CONST-033 clarification — distinguishing host events from sluggishness

Heavy container builds (BuildKit pulling many GB of layers, parallel
podman/docker compose-up across many services) can make the host
**appear** unresponsive — high load average, slow SSH, watchers
timing out. **This is NOT a CONST-033 violation.** Suspend / hibernate
/ logout are categorically different events. Distinguish via:

- `uptime` — recent boot? if so, the host actually rebooted.
- `loginctl list-sessions` — session(s) still active? if yes, no logout.
- `journalctl ... | grep -i 'will suspend\|hibernate'` — zero broadcasts
  since the CONST-033 fix means no suspend ever happened.
- `dmesg | grep -i 'killed process\|out of memory'` — OOM kills are
  also NOT host-power events; they're memory-pressure-induced and
  require their own separate fix (lower per-container memory limits,
  reduce parallelism).

A sluggish host under build pressure recovers when the build finishes;
a suspended host requires explicit unsuspend (and CONST-033 should
make that impossible by hardening `IdleAction=ignore` +
`HandleSuspendKey=ignore` + masked `sleep.target`,
`suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`, `hybrid-sleep.target`).

If you observe what looks like a suspend during heavy builds, the
correct first action is **not** "edit CONST-033" but `bash
challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` to confirm the
hardening is intact. If hardening is intact AND no suspend
broadcast appears in journal, the perceived event was build-pressure
sluggishness, not a power transition.
